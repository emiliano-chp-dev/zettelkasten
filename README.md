This is a template for a simple Zettelkasten workflow. To get one more worry out of the way, stick to the default font and theme. All other settings and plugin configurations are already set up.

This workflow uses [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as a reference manager. Install the [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) and [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) plugins and enable them.

Once that's done, creating reference notes is a few commands away. After you've annotated the sources inside Zotero, use `Ctrl + P` or `Command + P` to open Obsidian's command palette, and choose one of the `Import` formats. A note will automatically be created inside the `inbox` directory.

All new notes, regardless of scope, can be found in the `inbox` directory. Exceptions consist of `attachments`, `canvases`, and `tasks`, which go in their dedicated folders.

An `index` is created automatically using Dataview queries. See the documentation and learn how to create your own queries. You can forego this automation process if you want more freedom. See this video.

Create `atoms` (i.e. atomic notes) from references. These should be your own interpretation of the source material, with an eye on your projects. Don't create a wiki. Use the vault as an interlocutor.

Some notes may not be immediately relevant to your work-in-progress. Stow them away in the `cache` directory. Maybe they'll prove useful later down the road.

Don't overthink. Don't overengineer the vault. The plugins I've configured are exhaustive for a smooth workflow. You can make do with fewer. Remember that the use case of a Zettelkasten is to act as a conversation partner, to help you complete your projects and reach your goals.

A final note. I use `Vim key bindings`. If you don't know what that is, take a glance over this. It's useful, but not mandatory. P.S. Do not into the rabbit hole.

Carpe diem!
